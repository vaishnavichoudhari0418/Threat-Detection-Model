ðŸ“„ Project Summary: Deep Learning-Driven Threat Detection for Cloud Computing
This project develops a real-time threat detection model specially designed for cloud environments, using deep learning techniques.
The model automatically analyzes network activities, detects anomalies, identifies cyber threats, and helps prevent attacks with high accuracy and minimal false positives.
It aims to create a secure, intelligent, and scalable security system for modern cloud infrastructures.

Key Points:

Real-time detection of threats in cloud systems.

Uses advanced deep learning models (like CNN, LSTM, Autoencoders).

Focuses on high detection accuracy with very few false alarms.

Helps in proactive attack prevention and response.

Designed to scale and adapt to large cloud environments.
